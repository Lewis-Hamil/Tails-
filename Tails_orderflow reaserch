Non gaussian tails on order flow 

I wanted to re work how we measure tails in distribution so I borrowed at first from wavelet science as I understand that as 
a non-gaussian way of measuring distribution that then evolved into using a LaPlace kernel this needed future data so I estimate 
it using a metropolis hastings algorithm to look forward so the Laplace kernel works this is very computationally heavy so I added
a Kalman filter to smooth the data I wanted then to relate back to wavelet science however as wavelets are a scale filter and the
LaPlace MH-KF is a temporal filter I didn’t want to be over fitting the data so I decided to add the wavelets as a entropy filter, what
I'm saying is wavelets are very useful in situations where entropy is compressed so by having entropy bands wavelets can kick on when 
necessary to make the tails more accurate. As this is an order flow model I decided to do permutational entropy as this is better suited to 
order flow than other types of entropy, using quant connect I researched to find the bands that entropy works on for MNQ, after  Processing total
of 548,189 data points using quant connect, then averaging out that data we came to the end for permutational entropy definitions for entropy as Compressed 
(Low PE): PE ≤ ~0.945 Normal: 0.945 < PE < ~0.962 Chaotic (High PE): PE ≥ ~0.962  we can use these as bands to decide when the wavelets kicks in. 

also add your own data source this is just a skeleton
